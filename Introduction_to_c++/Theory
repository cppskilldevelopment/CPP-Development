C++ is a genral purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in
1979 at Bell labs as an extension of C language. It is often called "C with 
Classes" because it adds the concepts of object-Oriented programming (OOP) 
to the C language.

Features Of C++:
1) Copiled Language: Translate human readable code into machin code
2) Middle-level language: Supports both low-level(hardware ) and high level(User-level) programming.
3) Object oriented programming: Supports classses,objects,inheritance,abstraction,Encapsulation,Polymorphism
4) Rich-standard library: provide many inbuilt functions
5) Portable: Same program can run on multiple platforms with little/no modification.
6)Memory Management: Allows Manual coutrol and also supports smart pointers in modern C++.
7) Multi Paradigm: Supports Procedural Programming (like C) and OOP


Structure Of C++ program:

#include<iostream>         //preprocessor directive
using namespace std;       //Using standard namespace

int main()                 //Main function
{

    cout<<"Hello Ashu"     //Output statement

    return 0;              // Exit status of the program
}

Breakdown:
= #include<iostream>    => Includes input/output stream library
= using namespace std;  =>allows usage of standard library names without prefixing std::
= int main()            =>starting point of every c++ program
= cout                  =>Console output
= return 0;             =>Ends the program succesfully
